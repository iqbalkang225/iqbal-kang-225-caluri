<p id="description">This calorie counter app helps you keep track of your daily food intake and stay healthy. With a detailed log of each meal you can stay on top of your caloric goals and monitor your diet to ensure you stay ontrack. All of the data is presented in a simple and intuitive design so tracking your food intake is easy and hassle-free. 

This is a front-end application designed to provide a practical learning experience. The primary goal was to gain a deeper understanding of web development and to create a functional and well-designed application from scratch.</p>
